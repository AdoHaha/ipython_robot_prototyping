    "Topic, Service, and Parameter are the main parts of ROS. Each simplifies some particular type of communication inside ROS so that your robots can do stuff efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "**Topic** is used when we don't care who writes the message and who reads the message as long as it is on the right topic and of the right format (i.e. \"What is the **temperature** outside?\" - someone asks. \"It is 5 **degrees Celcius**\" answers someone) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Service** is a different format, where we ask for some calculation or action and receive response **in return**.\n",
    "I.e. (I ask \"how do you do, robot?\", and I receive \"fine, thank you\").\n",
    "Both command and response need to be in a format that we agreed upon. Also, there can be only one agent (i.e. one robot) with a particular service. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter** is a common database of parameters that can be read or written by ROS nodes (programms). Such parameters may be the hardware configuration, robot description or some other settings. Usually, they are read by a node when initializing (starting)."
